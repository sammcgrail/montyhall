This is one simulation of the Monty Hall Problem, described as follows:

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Run the simulation from your terminal with the following command:
```
ruby montyhall.rb
```

Output should look similar to below:
